When you spread an array into an object, it will add a key: value pair to the object for each array item, where the key is the index and the value is the value stored at that index in the array. It will come out as id: 1, title: "conjuiring", rating, "R" etc list all the KEYS and VALUES. <- so I can use the constructor and get everything I want from it in the format that I need.
